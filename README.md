# Data Loading Utility for Barebones Linear Regression

This project provides utility functions for loading data and implementing linear regression from scratch, without using scikit-learn.

## Usage

1. Install NumPy:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

2. Import and use the utility functions:
```python
from utils import load_data, load_data_multi

# For single-feature dataset
X, y = load_data()


## Linear Regression Implementation

This project is a barebones implementation of linear regression, showcasing an in-depth understanding of the concept without relying on high-level machine learning libraries.
